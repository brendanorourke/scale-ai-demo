## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom insurance-themed color palette
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o vision API
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query

### Data Flow

1. **User Upload**: User uploads an image of a damaged vehicle
2. **Image Processing**: Image is converted to base64 format for API transmission
3. **API Request**: Encoded image is sent to OpenAI's API with a specialized prompt
4. **Analysis**: The AI model analyzes the image for vehicle details and damage assessment
5. **Response Processing**: JSON response is parsed and displayed to the user
6. **User Interface**: Results are presented in an organized, easy-to-read format

### Key Components

- **WizardContext**: Manages the multi-step wizard flow and assessment data
- **ApiKeyContext**: Handles API key storage and provider selection
- **Image Analysis Service**: Interfaces with OpenAI's API for image analysis
- **Step Components**: Dedicated components for each wizard step (Welcome, Upload, Results)

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## üîê Security

- API keys are stored locally in the browser's localStorage
- API keys are never transmitted to our servers
- All API requests are made directly from the client to OpenAI

## üß© Future Enhancements

- **Anthropic Integration**: Support for Claude models coming soon
- **Export Functionality**: Ability to export assessment reports as PDF
- **History Management**: Save and review previous assessments
- **Detailed Repair Breakdown**: Itemized repair cost estimates
